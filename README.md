# Face Recognition Based Attendance System #
This project has been developed as part of Engage 2022.
* The demo for this project is given in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX34EYmtCy8. Mind that I missed to describe one feature of website i.e "remove attendance" button of attendance page in video and kindly read description of the video to know about that feature.
* I tried to deploy it in heroku that is why procfile is present but there were some conflicts coming like opencv-python and numpy conflict and hence I was not able to deploy but anyway the website is running perfectly fine as you can see in the video.
