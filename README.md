# Face Recognition Based Attendance System #
This project has been developed as part of Engage 2022.
* The detailed demo for this project is given in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX34EYmtCy8. Mind that I missed to describe one feature of website i.e "remove attendance" button of attendance page in video and kindly read description of the video to know about that feature.
* I tried to deploy it in heroku that is why procfile is present but there were some conflicts coming like opencv-python and numpy conflict and hence I was not able to deploy but anyway the website is running perfectly fine as you can see in the video.

# Procedure to run the web app:
* Firstly, you should have libraries like open-cv python, pandas, face_recognition, flask, flask-sqlalchemy as marked in the requirements.txt file.
* Clone this repository and move to AttendanceSystem folder.
* Activate the virtual environment by typing source /.venv/bin/activate in the terminal.
* Run the app.py file.
* You should have gotten http://127.0.0.1:8000/ url. Copy and paste it in the browser of your choice and relook at the demo video to understand the functioning.
